# ECE 580 Final Project

This repository contains the source code from my Digital Systems Design final project.
The semester I took Digial Systems design, the final project's requirements were to 
remake the game Snake on a Basys 3 board. Students were given bonus points for going
"above and beyond". I earned my bonus points by creating the HDL to play the game both
in 480p and in 1080p output. The tight deadline of the project combined with the 
relatively fast clock required for 1080p logic meant pushing the Basys 3's Artix-7 near
to its limits.

I apologize for the messy and hastily written code. I know it could have been done
better, however, I had to finish the project on time with only around four month's
worth of experience in Verilog.
